# DUDL

These notebooks are from "a Deep Understanding of Deep Learning" (DUDL) course taught by Mike X Cohen on Udemy. the code is mostly identical to the one provided by the instructor, but i have made changes as I am following along. Not a single line is copy-paste :)

Each section of the course is presented on a "chapter" notebook, however numbering is not consistent, and some long sections are broken down into multiple notebooks for practical purposes.
