# DUDL

These notebooks are from "A Deep Understanding of Deep Learning (DUDL)" course taught by Mike X Cohen on Udemy. The code is mostly identical to the one provided by the instructor, but i have written every single line from scratch and have made changes as I am following along, therefore there is no copy-and-paste at all :)

Each section of the course is presented on a "chapter" notebook, however numbering is not consistent, and some long sections are broken down into multiple notebooks for practical purposes.

A lot of code is repetitive, but this was necessary to practice as much as possible instead of running it once and add just the pieces later.

The course is really awesome, and I am learning a lot from it. Due to relocation and career changes, i had to stop after finishing more than 60% of it and restart from the beginning once again to get the most out of it.
